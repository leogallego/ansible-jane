# Skills Reference

How skills are organized, loaded, and when to use them.

## How Skills Work

There are three tiers of skills, each loaded differently:

| Tier | Location | How to load | When loaded |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Plugins** | Installed via Claude Code plugin system | Automatic — always available as invocable skills | Session start |
| **User skills** | `~/.claude/skills/` | `Skill: <name>` (invocable via Skill tool) | On demand |
| **Project skills** | `skills/` in repo | `Read` the SKILL.md file directly | On demand, before relevant work |

**Key distinction:** Plugin and user skills are invocable via the `Skill` tool. Project skills are reference files — read them with the `Read` tool before doing related work.

## Loading Protocol

### Every session
1. Load `android-cli` skill (invocable, user-level) — required for any device interaction

### Before implementation work
1. Read relevant project skills from `skills/` (see lookup table below)
2. Plugin skills (superpowers, code-review, etc.) are already available

### Before code review
1. Read `skills/kotlin-kmp-code-review/SKILL.md` for KMP review checklist
2. Read domain-specific skills for the area under review (Compose, coroutines, etc.)

### Adding new skills
Official Google/Android skills can be installed via:
```bash
android skills list          # see available skills
android skills add --skill=<name> --project=.  # install to project
```

## Plugins (always available)

Configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`. These provide invocable skills and tools.
